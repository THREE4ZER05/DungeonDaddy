# Privacy Policy for DungeonDaddy Bot

Effective Date: 18/03/2025

At DungeonDaddy, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us while using our bot. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal data we collect, how it is used, and how it is protected.

---

## Information We Collect

DungeonDaddy does not collect or store any personal data from users directly. However, the bot may collect certain information during interactions with Discord's API for the purpose of functioning within Discord. This information may include:

- **Discord User ID**: Used to identify users and associate them with their actions within the bot (e.g., creating or joining dungeon groups).
- **Discord Username and Discriminator**: Used to tag and display the user’s name for role selection, dungeon group creation, and event participation.
- **Messages**: DungeonDaddy may store messages temporarily to facilitate interactions such as role assignments or dungeon sign-ups. These messages are deleted once the relevant task is complete.

---

## How We Use the Information

The data we collect is used solely to provide and improve the functionality of the DungeonDaddy bot. Specifically, it is used for:

- **User Identification**: To associate actions such as role selection and dungeon group management with individual users.
- **Event Management**: To track dungeon group creation, sign-ups, and scheduling of runs.
- **User Communication**: To notify users about the status of dungeon runs or events they are involved in.

---

## Data Storage and Retention

DungeonDaddy does not store any personal data on a permanent basis. Data such as user actions and messages are only retained temporarily while a specific event or interaction is active. Once the event or interaction ends (e.g., a dungeon group is completed), the associated data is deleted.

---

## Third-Party Services

DungeonDaddy interacts with **Discord’s API** to function. However, we do not share any personal information with any third-party services, except as required to operate the bot within Discord.

---

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the data we collect. All personal data, including Discord usernames and IDs, is used only within the scope of bot functionality and is not shared with any third parties without your consent.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this page with an updated “Effective Date”.
